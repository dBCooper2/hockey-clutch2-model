With the time waning, the score is tied. Fans lean forward, sticks clash, and every pass is loaded
with consequence. In these last moments, players need abilities beyond skill to draw from: stamina, grit,
and the illusory ‘clutch’ factor. As fans of hockey, how is clutch defined? From that definition, how can
we rank players and teams to know which team is the most clutch, and therefore the most exciting? With
games competing in the same time slot on TV, and rising prices for tickets, how can a fan be sure that
their chosen experience will be the high-octane event that hockey is known to be? This notebook aims to
create a working definition for Clutch in the NHL, and classify teams and players who model this
definition.
